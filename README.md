This tool enables users to scan a top level domain with up to 5 levels of depth, or "clicks", including the option to follow external links beyond the initial domain. The level and reach of Ariadne's scans ensures all links are found. Ariande also features robust subdomain discovery tool complete with passive and active discovery methods, a wildcard detection system, and the ability to brute force subdomain searches. After these scans have completed, the tool allows users to perform 404 broken link checks, scans for key security headers, and will generate a sitemap on-the-fly.

When the user has sufficiently sluethed a site, Ariadne gives the option to export to a .csv file, and archive all discovered links, sites, and subdomains. Before the user archives anything, they are given the option to diff anything found during a scan. This diff function allows users to see if any changes have been made to the given page since the last time that page was saved to the Internet Archive. This diff function occurs during scheduled scans in order to minimize archiving unchanged pages.
