## Features


This tool provides comprehensive website scanning capabilities, starting from a main-level URL. It features robust subdomain discovery and allows you to configure the scan depth, including the option to follow external links beyond the initial domain. During a scan, the tool performs 404 broken link checks, scans for key security headers, and can generate a sitemap on-the-fly.

Key features include the ability to export all discovered links, sites, and subdomains to a .csv file for external analysis. You can also archive found links directly to the Internet Archive, with support for scheduling regular archives. Additionally, the tool offers a "diff" functionality to compare scan results over time, helping you track changes. For advanced use, it also supports the ability to add and use proxies for scanning.
